# Namaed_Entity_Recognition_Model
In the context of the project, we developed a Named Entity Recognition model leveraging several NLP techniques and incorporated state-of-the-art generative language models. This approach not only improved entity detection but also ensured the model could generalize well across multiple domains.
Data Preprocessing and Annotation:

Corpus Preparation: The first step involved preparing a large, diverse corpus annotated with named entities such as PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DATE, etc. Pre-labeled datasets alongside custom-annotated datasets are used for domain-specific needs.
Text Cleaning: Raw text data was processed to remove noise (e.g., punctuation, special symbols), tokenized (breaking the text into words or subwords), and normalized (e.g., lowercasing, handling special characters).
Data Augmentation: Techniques like synonym replacement, entity substitution, and back-translation were used to increase the diversity of the training dataset.

Feature Extraction using NLP Techniques:

Part-of-Speech Tagging: Tags such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives were assigned to each word to provide syntactic context.
Dependency Parsing: This was used to determine the grammatical structure of sentences, providing insights into the relationship between words, helping the model understand how entities are related.

Model Development using Advanced NLP Tools:
We utilized a combination of classical and cutting-edge NLP frameworks to implement and fine-tune our NER model.
Stanford NLP Toolkit, Stanza are the neural network-based NLP library that provides state-of-the-art performance in NER across multiple languages. Stanza uses bi-directional LSTM-CRF (Long Short-Term Memory â€“ Conditional Random Fields) models that excel in sequence tagging tasks. It was integrated into the pipeline for tasks requiring multi-lingual or domain-specific entity recognition.
